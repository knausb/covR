# covR
Tools to explore sequencing coverage in high-throughput sequencing projects


It has come to my attention that several other projects on GitHub share the name [covr](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=covR).
I plan to respect their priority.
This means that the name of this project will change at sometime in the future to something (hopefully) more unique.


While this project is in development it can be installed through github:

    devtools::install_github(repo="knausb/vcfR")
    library(vcfR)
